# Code Philosophy

Why these guidelines exist, what they protect, and who they serve.

---

## The Approach

Vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or build tools required. The constraint produces simpler code that is easier to debug — fewer layers of abstraction, no build pipeline to untangle. Writing without a framework requires more discipline, but the result is more transparent: changes are faster because there is less between you and the running code.

Named patterns applied through continuous refactoring, small commits, each one leaving the code cleaner than the last. Every rule in this doctrine was extracted from production code, not adapted from textbook examples. The examples are drawn from real applications; the failures they address were observed, debugged, and fixed before the rule was written.

This approach asks for more discipline up front than the default AI-assisted workflow. The goal is not to generate code faster at any cost, but to produce code that remains clear, stable, and maintainable as the project grows. Quality is not free, but low-quality acceleration is more expensive: the time saved by loose generation is usually paid back with interest in debugging, inconsistency, and maintenance.

- **No framework, no framework debt.** There is no abstraction layer to learn, no version to upgrade, no deprecation cycle to chase. The patterns used here — Active Object, Shared Key, event delegation, dispatch tables — are rooted in how the web platform works. They will work the same in ten years. See §Libraries, Frameworks, and TypeScript for the full reasoning.
- **A living code-guidelines document as a contract.** It keeps every contributor — human or AI — honest across sessions. It is not a suggestion file. It governs.
- **Pattern literacy over code generation.** Changes are justified by named refactoring patterns from the software engineering canon: Compose Method, Extract Shared Logic, Decompose Conditional. The question is never "does it work" — it is "is this the right abstraction?"
- **The AI is a pair programmer, not a code generator.** Its output is reviewed, challenged, and corrected. "Caught you slipping" is the expected dynamic, not an exception.

## What This Produces

Code that is future-proof, tuneable, maintainable, robust, clear, and fast. Vanilla JS starts at the performance ceiling — there is no framework overhead to optimize away. The guidelines compound: each refactoring encodes a principle that applies to the next, across projects. The codebase gets more consistent over time instead of accumulating layers of different authors' styles and framework idioms.

## Libraries, Frameworks, and TypeScript

This doctrine is not anti-library. It is anti-unnecessary indirection. The question is what a dependency buys you relative to its cost in abstraction, bytes, learning surface, and maintenance.

Specialized libraries such as D3, Anime.js, Three.js, and Chart.js are useful when they solve problems that are genuinely hard to address natively: data-driven SVG binding, physics-based animation, WebGL rendering, charting, and similar specialized work. They do not take over the architecture around them. Shared Key, Event Delegation, Fail-Safe, and module ownership still apply. Even here, use the smallest tool that solves the specific problem. A library built for generality often ships abstractions you do not need, and AI can now produce many narrower alternatives such as SVG path helpers, easing functions, animation loops, and data transforms as lightweight, purpose-built code.

General-purpose frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte were valuable responses to earlier platform constraints: weaker language ergonomics, slower DOM work, and teams that struggled to keep UI code disciplined at scale. Much of that rationale has weakened. Browsers improved, JavaScript improved, and AI-assisted development with enforced code guidelines now provides much of the speed and consistency frameworks once supplied. Frameworks are not forbidden here, but they are often redundant. Their cost is version churn, build complexity, opaque error stacks, abstraction over native DOM ownership, and less visibility into performance and memory behavior. The patterns in this doctrine are rooted in how the web platform works, so they age more slowly than framework conventions designed around older limitations.

Many framework patterns presented as essential are solutions to problems the framework itself imposed. When the framework's most celebrated patterns exist to solve the framework's own constraints, the framework is the complexity — not the solution to it.

### What React replaces — and what it replaced it with

**Routing.** The web platform provides `location.hash`, `hashchange`, `history.pushState`, and `popstate`. Routing is URL parsing plus a navigation event. The rest is application dispatch, not router machinery:

```javascript
function applyHash() {
  const h = (location.hash || '').replace(/^#/, '');
  const [tab, subtab, subview] = h.split('/');

  const section = tab
    ? document.getElementById(tab + '-content')
    : null;
  if (!section) { activateTab('home'); return; }

  activateTab(tab);
  if (subtab) activateSubtab(tab, subtab);
  if (subview) activateSubview(tab, subtab, subview);
}
window.addEventListener('hashchange', applyHash);
```

No route objects, router context, or navigation engine are required to keep tab state in sync with the URL. React Router wraps these platform APIs in components (`<Route>`, `<Link>`), hooks (`useNavigate`, `useParams`), and a matching engine — a dependency tree for capabilities the URL already provides. Deep-links work because the URL *is* the state.

**State management.** React's `useState` exists because functional components discard their scope on every render. The hook lets them remember values across re-renders. But the amnesia is React's design choice — not a platform constraint. A module-scoped variable persists naturally:

```javascript
// Module state — persists for the lifetime of the page.
const decoderState = { side: 'Left', region: 'IP',
  dir: 'ER' };

function updateDecoder() {
  const { side, region, dir } = decoderState;
  const equiv = getAllEquivalent(region, dir);
  updatePelvisSVG(equiv);
  renderEquivChain(side, region, dir, equiv);
}
```

No hook, no re-render, no stale closure. The state is a plain object. The update function reads it directly and writes to the DOM. For view toggling, one class on the ancestor and CSS does the rest — no state variable needed at all:

```javascript
let activeScreenClass = 'screen-config';
function showScreen(cls) {
  document.getElementById('masterquiz-content')
    .classList.replace(activeScreenClass, cls);
  activeScreenClass = cls;
}
```
```css
#masterquiz-content {
  #mq-config, #mq-quiz, #mq-results { display: none; }
  &.screen-config #mq-config,
  &.screen-quiz #mq-quiz,
  &.screen-results #mq-results { display: block; }
}
```

**Data fetching.** React's `useEffect` with an empty dependency array runs on mount — a workaround for the fact that functional components have no lifecycle. An init function called once does the same thing without the hook machinery, dependency arrays, or cleanup functions:

```javascript
export async function initDecoder() {
  try {
    const resp = await fetch('data/regions.json');
    if (!resp.ok) {
      showFetchError(container, 'decoder regions');
      return;
    }
    REGIONS = await resp.json();
  } catch (fetchErr) {
    showFetchError(container, 'decoder regions');
    return;
  }
  // Set up controls, render initial state.
}
```

No `useEffect`. No dependency array. No cleanup return. The function runs once, fetches data, handles errors visibly, and sets up the module. The lazy-loading system calls it the first time the user visits the tab.

TypeScript is a separate tradeoff, not the same discussion as frameworks. Its value is real: it catches a class of bugs before runtime. Its cost is also real: a build step, more surface area, and type machinery that can obscure intent or drift from runtime behavior at the edges. AI review now catches many of the same failures TypeScript was adopted to catch: bad signatures, null hazards, naming drift, and type confusion. The doctrine's naming rules and Fail-Safe principle address them through disciplined design and review. That makes TypeScript increasingly optional rather than foundational. Projects written in TypeScript still benefit from this doctrine fully. The doctrine does not depend on TypeScript. Treat it as a project-level overlay decision, not a prerequisite for code quality.

## The Market Reality

The volume of framework-heavy, AI-generated, nobody-reviewed code is growing. Developers who cannot distinguish a for loop from a DFS are churning out large applications built on the worst practices, compounding the existing mass of bloated framework code. This will produce spectacular failures.

When it does, the people who can point to principled, performant, maintainable vanilla code will be in a very different position. Code quality is not a luxury — it is a market differentiator. The code quality renaissance is here.

## Why This Cannot Be Easily Replicated

Someone could copy these guidelines and get mechanical value — a linter-level improvement. But the process requires judgment that guidelines cannot transfer:

- **An experienced developer** who knows the patterns by name can use the guidelines and push back on AI output effectively. They get most of the value.
- **A mid-level developer** follows the rules but does not know when to break them, when to push back, when the AI is slipping. They produce clean-looking code that misses the deeper design.
- **A vibe coder** ignores the guidelines within three prompts because they slow things down. That is the whole point — they slow things down *just enough* to get it right.

The edge is not the document. It is the ability to pair-program with an AI to make the code better.

## When Rules Conflict

The guidelines contain principles, rules, defaults, and heuristics. They are not all the same kind of statement, and they do not all carry the same weight.

- **Principles** govern judgment (Fail-Safe, Module Cohesion, DOM-Light). They are the reasons behind the rules.
- **Rules** are specific and testable (`===` always, no `addEventListener` in repeatable functions, all colors via custom properties). They are followed unless a principle overrides them.
- **Defaults** apply unless there is a stated reason not to ("favor source HTML," "prefer CSS over JS for state"). The word "prefer" or "avoid" signals a default.
- **Heuristics** are context-dependent guidance (extract shared logic, decompose conditional). They require judgment about when to apply.

When two rules pull in opposite directions, the more specific rule governs within its scope. When two rules of equal specificity conflict, the one closer to the user's experience wins: Fail-Safe outranks optimization, legibility outranks mechanical compliance.

Example: Extract Shared Logic says to extract duplicated structure into a parameterized function. But extraction is not justified by duplication alone — it is justified when it names an operation and makes the calling code read as a sequence of intentions. If extraction adds indirection without improving legibility at the call site, the extraction is not warranted. The principle (legible code) governs the heuristic (extract shared structure), not the other way around.

When the conflict is not resolvable by these rules, state the tension and ask. Do not silently pick a side.

## Shared Key: Why IDs Are the Architecture

The Shared Key pattern uses a unique `id` as a single-token address across every layer — DOM lookup, dispatch routing, data access. The rationale:

**Greppability.** A developer sees `cmap-edge-3` in the browser inspector, greps `cmap-edge` in the IDE, and lands exactly on the module that owns that logic. No prop-tracing through framework abstractions. No "which component renders this?" — the prefix IS the module.

**Zero-translation path.** Frameworks pay a translation tax on every interaction: Event → Synthetic Event → Action Creator → Reducer → State Update → Virtual DOM Diff → Real DOM Update. The Shared Key path is: Event → Dispatch Table[ID] → Method → getElementById(ID). A straight line from click to execution, with no intermediate representations.

**Reduced indirection.** Frameworks introduce ref objects, virtual keys, and state hooks that must be reconciled against a state tree. The Shared Key collapses the distinction between DOM identity and action route. The ID is the pointer — `getElementById` for the node, `DISPATCH[id]()` for the behavior, `data[id]` for the record. All O(1), all using the same string.

**Collision control as a simple contract.** Critics fear ID collisions, but module-owned prefixes make collisions a failure to follow the grep protocol, not a failure of the architecture. It is a social and technical contract that scales because it is simple, not because it is wrapped in a library. If two developers both use `edge-` for different features, the collision is visible in a single grep — not hidden behind framework-managed component scoping.

**Why frameworks avoid IDs.** React discourages `id` attributes because components may be rendered multiple times, producing duplicate IDs that break `getElementById` and accessibility associations. React provides `useId()` for accessibility attributes and `useRef()` for imperative DOM access — abstractions that solve a problem the framework created by taking DOM control away from the developer. Worse, `useId()` generates opaque tokens (`:r1:`, `:r2:`) that are meaningless to human readers, invisible to grep, and useless in the browser inspector — far from "give each identifier a meaningful name from the project's ubiquitous language." React could have encouraged unique, developer-chosen IDs scoped to component instances; instead it chose disposable machine-generated tokens. In vanilla JS, the developer controls instantiation. If you need two calendars, you parameterize the ID from the caller (`salon-calendar`, `deliveries-calendar`) and there is no duplication because you decided how many instances exist and what each one is called. The Shared Key pattern works because the developer manages DOM identity directly — no reconciliation layer can invalidate an ID the developer explicitly created and maintains.

**The triple-threat.** A meaningful, human-readable ID — named from the project's ubiquitous language — is the universal coordinate across JS dispatch, DOM lookup, and CSS styling. See it in the inspector, find it in the code, know what it represents. No translation layer to hide bugs.

| Layer | Implementation | Doctrine |
|---|---|---|
| JS | `CLICK_DISPATCH['prefix-id']` | O(1) Dispatch |
| DOM | `id="prefix-id-3"` | Namespaced Address |
| CSS | `.anatomize-label`, `.equiv-opt` | Module-prefixed classes |

## Good Names

Correct terminology is not cosmetic. When code, data, selectors, and documentation use the same domain terms, moving from user terminology to implementation requires no translation. That reduces debugging cost, improves grepability, and lowers the risk of model drift.

Identifiers with material accuracy — `pelvisRotationDegrees` instead of `val`, `activeDragItem` instead of `dragging`, `ABBR_TITLES` instead of `MAP`. The name describes the domain reality, not the programming artifact. If the user calls it a "concept map," the code says `conceptMap` — not `cmap`. Programmer shorthand (`mq`, `expl`, `btn`) forces a translation in the reader's head; domain abbreviations do not, because they are the language of the domain itself. A medical app uses `ADT` and `PADT` because the clinicians do. A trading app uses `WTI` and `EUR` because the traders do. A dental app uses `FMX` and `BW` because the hygienists do. These are not programmer abbreviations — they are the vocabulary of the people the software serves.

Module-scoped variables in ES modules are not globals. Even if they were, a unique name with a descriptive prefix provides a logical namespace that the human brain (and grep) can navigate effortlessly. The "fear of globals" is a framework-era anxiety that does not apply to module-scoped state with material-accuracy naming. Name it well, scope it to the module, and move on.

The grep test: if you can find a feature by searching for the same word the user uses, the naming is correct. If you have to know that the user's "concept map" is `cmap` in the code, the naming has failed. Generic frameworks reward generic naming; this doctrine prefers custom-fit domain naming that makes the code an explicit map of the system it models.

## The CSS Engine as a State Machine

The browser's CSS engine is a declarative partner to the JS logic, not just a painting tool.

**Zero-iteration styling.** The Ancestor Class pattern — one state class on a common ancestor, descendant rules in CSS — offloads state-based visual changes to the browser's C++ style-recalc pass. No JS loops toggling classes on descendants. Example: `#equivalence-content.showing-results .equiv-quiz-wrap` — the ancestor gets the class, the cascade hides/shows the descendants.

**Predictable collision guard.** A collision in CSS is a violation of the Module Ownership contract. If two modules' styles conflict, it means they didn't grep for the prefix before implementation. The same contract that prevents ID collisions in JS prevents selector collisions in CSS.

## Defaults and Exceptions

The guidelines use "avoid," "prefer," and "where possible" to signal defaults. A default is not a suggestion — it is the expected behavior in the common case. Taking an exception requires a stated reason.

Valid reasons for exceptions:
- The alternative violates a higher-priority rule.
- The platform or browser imposes a constraint that makes the default inapplicable.
- The specific context has been discussed and an exception approved.

Invalid reasons:
- "It felt right."
- "It was easier."
- "The other approach also works."

When taking an exception, comment the code stating which default is overridden and why. This prevents a future reader from "fixing" the code back to the default and breaking the design.

## Adopting the Doctrine

The guidelines are the canonical doctrine. They are not a project-specific document with transfer notes — they are the standard, and individual projects overlay their own decisions on top.

**The doctrine** — principles, patterns, language rules, formatting, and comments policy — applies to any vanilla JS browser application without modification. The examples in `code-guidelines.md` are drawn from real projects (anatomy tools, quiz systems, interactive maps). They illustrate the rules; they are not requirements. A dental scheduling app, a commodity trading dashboard, and a medical reference tool all follow the same Fail-Safe, Shared Key, and Event Delegation rules — with different domain vocabulary, different data shapes, and different UI concerns.

**Project overlays** handle decisions that vary by project:
- Directory names and structure (app/dev separation is doctrine; specific directory names are overlay)
- Asset management strategy (service worker precache, build tool manifests, or neither)
- Typography (system font stacks are the default; brand typefaces are an overlay decision)
- Minimum target viewport width (320px is typical; the project spec may set a different floor)
- Theming (light/dark is doctrine when theming is needed; whether theming is needed is a project decision)
- Color system (CSS custom properties for all colors is a strong default; a two-color utility app may not need the indirection)

A project overlay is a separate file — not a fork of the doctrine. For example, the [PRI Pelvis Restoration study tool](https://github.com/GarrettS/pelvis) uses `prd/project.md` as its overlay — directory structure, asset rules, content authority, and architecture decisions live there. The doctrine evolves; overlays track project-specific decisions that the doctrine intentionally leaves open. When the overlay contradicts the doctrine, the overlay must state which rule it overrides and why, per §Defaults and Exceptions.
