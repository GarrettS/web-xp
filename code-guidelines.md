# Code Guidelines

Standards for web application development. Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks, no build tools.

Baseline authorities for formatting: [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html), and [Code Guidelines for Rich Internet Application Development](https://web.archive.org/web/20240805191807/http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/code-guidelines/) by Garrett Smith et al. The Formatting section below overrides and extends those guides. Where both this document and the Formatting section are silent, defer to the baseline authorities.

Tool-specific workflow rules (commit process, verification, tool constraints) belong in the project's workflow contract (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.cursor/rules` for Cursor, or a team runbook). That file governs how work is done; this file governs what the code looks like.

## Design Principles

These principles govern judgment calls. They are not suggestions.

### Fail-Safe

**No unhandled exceptions and no silent failure paths. Every failure must resolve to a defined safe outcome.**

- When the failure affects the user's task or understanding, that outcome must be **user-visible**: a message, a retry option, a fallback, or a graceful degradation.
- When a feature is optional and the app functions without it, **intentional degradation** is acceptable — but it must be a deliberate design decision, not an accident. Comment the code stating what is degraded and why.

Three failure modes violate this:

1. **Unhandled throw.** An exception propagates up the stack with no `catch` that presents a user-visible response. The app enters an undefined state. A helper that checks `response.ok` and throws has not handled the failure — it has relocated it. The caller still crashes if it does not catch, and `console.error` in a `catch` block is not a user-visible response.
2. **Silent return.** A function returns `null`, `undefined`, or an empty value after a failure. The caller receives a sentinel instead of data, must check for it, and if it does not, the app breaks downstream. The user sees nothing.
3. **Console-only catch.** A `catch` block logs to the console and continues. The error is swallowed. The user sees nothing. The app proceeds on invalid state.

"Handling" means the user sees a message, a retry option, a fallback, or a graceful degradation.

**Two categories of failure must be addressed:**
- *Runtime failures* — network errors, parse failures, storage quota exceeded, missing resources. Catch at the source. Do not let upstream failures cascade into downstream reference errors.
- *User errors* — invalid input, out-of-range values, malformed data. Validate, give clear feedback, do not proceed with bad data.

Specific operations that require guarded handling:
- `fetch()` — network errors and HTTP error status. Both paths need a user-visible response.
  ```javascript
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      showError('Could not load quiz data. Check your connection.');
      return;
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    renderQuiz(data);
  } catch (err) {
    showError('Could not load quiz data. Check your connection.');
  }
  ```
- `JSON.parse()` — malformed data must not crash the app. Wrap in `try/catch` with a user-visible response on failure.
- `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` — browsers throw in private mode or when quota is exceeded. Wrap access in `try/catch` with a user-visible response or silent degradation (feature works without persistence).
- Fire-and-forget async — any `async` function called without `await` must have `.catch()` at the call site with a user-visible response.

### Ubiquitous Language

Variables, class names, CSS selectors, function names, DOM IDs, JSON keys, and documentation use the same terms the domain uses. If the user says "concept map," the code says `conceptMap` — not `cmap`, `graph`, or `diagram`. If the authoritative domain reference uses an abbreviation, the data may store it and the UI expands it at render time. Use domain abbreviations, not programmer shorthand.

This principle unifies:
- **Identifier naming** — materially accurate names from the domain
- **CSS selectors** — semantic names from the domain
- **Shared Key** — module-owned prefixes and IDs that name the domain concept
- **Module Cohesion** — file names that describe the domain responsibility

Mismatch between domain language and code language is a defect. It inserts a translation layer into reading, debugging, and maintenance, increasing the chance that the developer's mental model drifts from the actual system. Features must be discoverable by searching for the same words the user, PRD, and authoritative domain reference use.

### Module Cohesion

Each module owns one domain concept. Name the module after what it does: `quiz.js`, `flashcards.js`, `navigation.js`. If the name describes a role instead of a domain concept, it is a junk drawer — `utils.js`, `helpers.js`, `tools.js`, `misc.js`, `common.js` are common examples, but any name that could apply to any project instead of *this* project violates the principle. If a function does not belong in an existing module, create a new module with a specific name. When a module grows to cover multiple concerns, split it.

### Minimize Traversal Scope

Do not search a broader part of the DOM than the task requires. When the element, ancestor, or key is already known, address it directly instead of scanning. When search is necessary, constrain it to the smallest subtree or event path that can contain the answer.

- **[Active Object](#active-object)** — the element is known; address it directly.
- **[Event Delegation](#event-delegation)** — the ancestor is known; resolve within the event path.
- **[Shared Key](#shared-key)** — the key is known; look up by ID, not by query.
- **[DOM-Light](#dom-light)** — fewer nodes means shorter traversals.

### DOM-Light

Favor source HTML over JS-generated markup. Do not use JavaScript to solve what HTML already does natively. Examples:
- `<form>` with `.reset()` instead of looping through inputs to clear them manually
- `<button type="button">` instead of `<button>` with `preventDefault` to avoid submission
- `<details>` instead of a `div` with JS toggle logic

Keep the DOM to the simplest semantic structure necessary — more markup means more bytes, more parsing, and a larger tree for scripts to traverse. When creating elements dynamically, use `createElement`.

### Directory Structure

Separate app code from dev tools. App code lives in designated directories by type (scripts, styles, data, assets). Dev tools live in their own directory, not mixed with app code. The project root contains only files that must be there (entry HTML, files with browser scope constraints) and project documentation.

### Progressive Enhancement

Use progressive enhancement sparingly, and generally avoid polyfills. Degrade gracefully; don't try hamfisted approaches to force it to work in all browsers.

### Explicit Asset Lists

When code enumerates project assets — precache manifests, build tool file lists, resource loaders — each entry must be individually justified by an app code reference. Dev tools and documentation are not app code; a reference from a dev tool does not justify inclusion in an asset list. Never glob-include a directory. An asset list is a contract: every entry is used by the running app, every app-used asset is listed. When files are added or removed, update asset lists in the same commit.

## Patterns

Implementation patterns for DOM-heavy vanilla JS applications.

### Event Delegation

Attach one handler to a stable ancestor and inspect `event.target`. This scales, avoids initialization loops, and works for dynamically added elements.

Know the event target ([Minimize Traversal Scope](#minimize-traversal-scope)). Use `event.target` when the event fires on the actionable element. For events such as `dragstart` that fire on the actionable element itself, use `event.target` directly when no nested draggable descendant can be the target. When nested markup can receive the event and upward resolution is needed, use `closest()` to find the actionable ancestor. Attach the listener to the nearest common ancestor, not a distant parent. The event path defines the search space; do not expand it.

❌ Per-element listeners in a build function — accumulate on reset, create N identical closures:
```javascript
function buildList(items) {
  ul.innerHTML = '';
  items.forEach((item) => {
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.addEventListener('click', () => handleItem(item));
    ul.appendChild(li);
  });
}
```

❌ Shared function, but still per-element — no accumulation, but N bindings for one concern:
```javascript
function buildList(items) {
  ul.innerHTML = '';
  items.forEach((item) => {
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.addEventListener('click', itemClickHandler);
    ul.appendChild(li);
  });
}
```

✅ Delegation — one listener, attached once, handles all current and future children:
```javascript
ul.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const li = e.target.closest('.item');
  if (!li) return;

  handleItem(li);
});
```

Attach listeners once. Never place `addEventListener` in a function that can be called more than once — listeners accumulate (there is no `replaceEventListener`). Separate one-time initialization (DOM refs, listeners) from repeatable actions (reset state, re-render). `init` may call `reset`; `reset` must never call `init`.

Do not speculatively cache DOM references the code may never use. `getElementById` is a hash-table lookup — fast enough to call at point of use. Speculative caching adds a sync burden (HTML changes require updating the cache) and initialization cost for elements the user may never interact with.

### Active Object

For exclusive-active state (tabs, selections, panels): hold a reference to the currently active element. On switch, deactivate it directly, then activate the new one. Never `querySelectorAll` to scan siblings and remove a class. This is the same principle as [Minimize Traversal Scope](#minimize-traversal-scope): do not scan a set when you already have the element you need.

### Shared Key

When a data record and a DOM element represent the same entity, give them the same `id`. This single key indexes both — data by object property, DOM by `getElementById`, dispatch table by action route. Do not search either collection for a known key. This is the keyed form of [Minimize Traversal Scope](#minimize-traversal-scope): when the key is known, address directly instead of searching.

- **Data format**: structure JSON as a keyed object (`{"item-foo": {...}}`) instead of an array of objects with `id` fields (`[{"id": "foo", ...}]`). When data is looked up by key, the source format should be keyed — no runtime indexing step needed.
- **Module ownership**: modules that generate IDs use a prefix or parameterized name to keep them unique. Dynamic elements use prefix + index (e.g. `order-item-0`, `search-result-3`). Widgets that can have multiple instances (resize bar, drag handle, calendar) take an ID parameter from the caller — each instance gets a unique ID derived from that parameter (e.g. `salon-calendar`, `deliveries-calendar`). Two elements with the same ID is a bug. Framework-era advice to avoid `id` attributes does not apply here — see `code-philosophy.md` §Shared Key.
- **DOM side**: use the namespaced key as the element's `id` attribute. Lookup is `getElementById(id)`. Related elements use convention-based suffixes (e.g. `id + "-detail"`), each directly addressable.
- **One key across all layers**: the same string appears in JSON keys, element `id` attributes, SVG element `id` attributes, and JS lookups. No translation between layers.
- **Access pattern (getById)**: event delegation derives the key from the target element's `id`, then addresses both data (`map[id]`) and DOM (`getElementById(id)`) directly. When construction is expensive, use create-on-first-access: `pool[id] || (pool[id] = create(id))`.
- **Antipattern**: `.find(item => item.id === id)`, `querySelector('[data-id="' + id + '"]')` — linear scans for a known key.

### Ancestor Class for Batch Styles

To style a group of descendants, add a class to the nearest common ancestor. Define the CSS rule as `.state-class .descendant-class`. Never loop through descendants to set `element.style`.

❌ Toggling visibility on each element:
```javascript
quizWrap.classList.add('hidden');
scoreEl.classList.add('hidden');
resultsEl.classList.remove('hidden');
```

✅ One class on the ancestor, CSS cascade w/nested rule does the rest:
```javascript
section.classList.add('showing-results');
```
```css
#section.showing-results {
  #quiz-wrap, #score { display: none; }
  #results { display: block; }
}
```

### Inline Styles in Scripts

Avoid inline styles — use CSS classes. When dynamic inline styles cannot be avoided (e.g. computed positions), assign multiple values via `element.style.cssText` rather than setting individual `style` properties one at a time.

### CSS over JS for State Presentation

Use CSS for visual state changes wherever possible. Prefer `:hover`, `:focus`, `:not(.class)`, and `pointer-events` over JS event handlers (`mouseenter`/`mouseleave`) and programmatic `disabled` toggling. If CSS can express the rule, JS should not be involved.

### `hidden` Attribute for Visibility

Use the native `hidden` attribute for show/hide toggling instead of `style.display`. It is semantic, works without knowing the element's display type, and is removable with `el.hidden = false`.

### Extract Shared Logic

When two or more code blocks follow the same structure but differ in specific values or operations, extract the shared structure into a function parameterized by the varying parts. Pass data for values that differ; pass a function for operations that differ. This applies to DOM construction, string building, iteration — any structural duplication. The extracted function encapsulates *structure*; the caller supplies *what varies*.

### Dispatch Table

When a chain of conditionals maps a value to an action, replace it with a keyed object. The table makes the mapping visible at a glance, is trivial to extend, and separates routing from logic.

❌ Conditional chain:
```javascript
if (id === 'submit') handleSubmit();
else if (id === 'new-session') resetSession();
else if (id === 'end-session') renderResults();
else if (id === 'retake-missed') retakeMissed();
```

✅ Dispatch table — pairs naturally with event delegation:
```javascript
const CLICK_DISPATCH = {
  'equiv-submit': handleSubmit,
  'equiv-new-session': resetSession,
  'equiv-end-session': renderResults,
  'equiv-retake-missed': retakeMissed
};

section.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const target = e.target.closest('[id]');
  CLICK_DISPATCH[target?.id]?.();
});
```

### Functions

Functions must do one thing. The name must clearly reflect what that thing is. Consistent return type — callers should not need to check which shape came back. Pure where possible. Three or fewer parameters; use an options object when more context is needed. Within a function, each step operates at the same level of abstraction — the body reads as a table of contents for the operation. When a chain of conditionals routes to different actions, consider a dispatch table or function redefinition.

Inline callbacks follow the same rule. The listener is routing; the function is logic.

❌ Logic buried in callback:
```javascript
el.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const target = e.target.closest('.item');
  if (!target) return;
  // ... 30 lines of processing ...
});
```

✅ Callback delegates to named function:
```javascript
el.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const target = e.target.closest('.item');
  if (!target) return;

  processItem(target);
});
```

### Decompose Conditional

When a boolean expression is complex, extract it into a named variable or function that reads as intent. The name replaces the logic, making the condition's purpose obvious at the call site.

### Template and cloneNode

When creating multiple similar elements in a loop, build one template element outside the loop with shared attributes and classes, then `cloneNode(false)` inside the loop and set only the per-instance values. Avoids redundant `createElement` / `setAttribute` / `classList.add` calls per iteration.

## Formatting

### General

- Line length: target 80 columns, 90 maximum. Break long concatenation and conditionals across lines.

### HTML

- Lowercase tags, quoted attributes.
- No self-closing slash where end tag is forbidden (`<img>` not `<img />`).

### CSS

- External stylesheets only. No inline `<style>` blocks.
- One declaration per line, opening brace on selector line, one blank line between rules.
- Space after the colon in property declarations: `margin: 0` not `margin:0`.
- In CSS functions like `rgb()`, include a single space after each comma.

### JavaScript

- Semicolons explicit. Do not rely on ASI. Restricted productions (`return`, `throw`, `break`, `continue`, postfix `++`/`--`): the expression must start on the same line as the keyword. Do not add a semicolon after a function declaration, block, switch, or try/catch — a semicolon there is an empty statement.
- Use template literals for large multi-line HTML/SVG builders. Use concatenation for short one-liners.

---

## Language Rules

Semantic and behavioral rules. Where these overlap with the baseline authorities, this document governs.

### HTML

- Valid markup. Code that uses malformed HTML is expecting nonstandard behavior. When a browser encounters an HTML error it performs proprietary error correction, producing a DOM that differs from what the code expects.
- Semantic elements: headings, nav, section, article — not generic divs. Nav lists, not buttons. ARIA roles where semantics fall short.
- No inline styles except those set dynamically by JS at runtime.
- No `javascript:` pseudo-protocol.
- No inline event handler attributes (`onclick`, `onchange`, etc.).

### CSS

- Separate structure from domain styles (e.g., `layout.css` for shared primitives; `css/<domain>.css` for each module).
- Class and id selectors must have semantic meaning. `.redButton` is meaningless; `.errorAction` represents a state. See: [Use class with semantics in mind](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/goodclassnames). Use unambiguous names from the project's ubiquitous language: `activeTab`, `activeSubtab` — not `.active`.
- Modular CSS: each file groups conceptually-related functionality, does one thing, and minimizes dependence on other CSS files.
- All colors via CSS custom properties. Never hardcode hex or rgb in rules. Define custom properties on `:root` in the CSS file that owns the concept. If a dark mode override is needed, define it in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in the same file.
- System font stacks by default. No CDN fonts unless the project spec requires a brand typeface — and if it does, self-host; do not load from third-party CDNs at runtime. Scalable font sizes using `clamp()` — define a font scale as custom properties on `:root` and use those for all `font-size` declarations. No fixed `px` or bare `rem` font sizes in rules.
- Mobile-first. Base styles target small screens; widen with `min-width` media queries. Images: `max-width: 100%; height: auto`. Overlay positioning uses percentages. No layout element should require horizontal scrolling at the project's minimum target viewport width (typically 320px).
- Light/dark theme via `prefers-color-scheme` when the project supports theming. Define light as `:root` default, dark in the media query. No manual toggle unless the project spec requires one.

### JavaScript

- **Modules.** `<script type="module">` — strict mode by default. ES modules with explicit exports. Do not wrap an entire module body in an IIFE — the module already provides scope. IIFEs remain useful for creating closures within a module (e.g. binding private state to a function).
- **Functions.** Use function declarations for named module-level functions (hoisted, readable top-down). Use arrow functions instead of anonymous function expressions when `this` doesn't matter or is wanted from the enclosing context. Use function expressions when the handler needs `this` bound to the element by `addEventListener`.
- **Variables.** Declare with `const` or `let`, close to first use. Minimize the visibility of the identifier, but maximize the stability of the implementation — keep the variable narrow, but keep the function it references in a stable scope so you aren't punishing the engine. No assignment to undeclared identifiers.
- **Function allocation.** Any anonymous function inside a repeated code path (loop, handler, render, timer) that doesn't close over per-execution state is a redundant allocation. Define functions once at a stable scope; reference them from the hot path.

  | Approach | Readability | Performance | Use when |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Inline anonymous | High (logic in place) | Low (constant re-creation) | One-shot code paths only |
  | Hoisted named | Medium (jump to def) | High (single allocation) | Loops, renders, handlers |
  | Event delegation | Medium (abstracted) | Highest (minimal footprint) | Large/dynamic DOM trees |

  How to spot the anti-pattern: any anonymous function defined inside a function that runs more than once. If you can move it outside and nothing breaks, it should be outside.

  ❌ Function recreated on every click:
  ```javascript
  revealBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const html = parts.map(
      ([k, v]) => '<strong>' + k + ':</strong> ' + v
    ).join('<br>');
  });
  ```

  ✅ Formatter defined once, referenced by name:
  ```javascript
  function formatKeyValue([k, v]) {
    return '<strong>' + k + ':</strong> ' + v;
  }

  revealBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const html = parts.map(formatKeyValue)
      .join('<br>');
  });
  ```
- **Naming conventions.** Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Functions/variables: `camelCase`. Classes: `PascalCase`. Booleans prefixed: `is`/`has`/`does`/`can`. Event handler functions: `[object][EventName]Handler` (e.g. `itemClickHandler`, `formSubmitHandler`). Functions that process results but do not receive an event object are not handlers — name them by what they do (e.g. `validateInput`, `saveRecord`). Give each identifier a meaningful name from the project's ubiquitous language.
- **Identifier naming.** Materially accurate. Names describe the domain reality, not the programming artifact. No generic state words (`active`, `hidden`, `val`, `data`, `item`). No abbreviations (`cmap`, `mq`, `expl`) — use full terms (`conceptMap`, `masterQuiz`, `explanation`). State variables within a module should mirror the module's DOM prefix to maintain a single address space.

  ❌ Generic or abbreviated:
  ```javascript
  const MAP = {};
  const active = null;
  const val = getRotation();
  ```

  ✅ Materially accurate:
  ```javascript
  const ABBR_TITLES = {};
  const activeDragItem = null;
  const pelvisRotationDegrees = getRotation();
  ```
- **Guard clauses.** Use early `return` to reject invalid state at the top of a function rather than wrapping the body in a conditional. Always follow a guard clause with a blank line so the pattern stands out visually.
  ```javascript
  function update(id) {
    if (!id) return;

    // function body
  }
  ```
- **DOM content.** `textContent` over `innerHTML`. Use `innerHTML` only when inserting HTML structure.
- **Form submission.** No form submission on Enter unless that is the intended UX. Prevent default on `keydown` where needed.
- **Strict equality.** `===` always. Do not use Boolean coercion on values that may be acceptably falsy (e.g., `if (e.pageX)`). Use `typeof`: `if (typeof e.pageX === 'number')`.
- **String concatenation.** Do not `+=` in a loop — each iteration creates and discards an intermediate string. Use `.join()` for uniform items; use `.map()` + `.join('')` when each item needs distinct attributes.

  ❌ `+=` in a loop creates n intermediate strings:
  ```javascript
  let html = '<ul>';
  items.forEach((item) => { html += '<li>' + item + '</li>'; });
  html += '</ul>';
  ```

  ✅ Uniform items — join with delimiter (guard empty case):
  ```javascript
  if (items.length) {
    el.innerHTML = '<ul><li>' + items.join('</li><li>') + '</li></ul>';
  }
  ```

  ✅ Per-item attributes — map + join:
  ```javascript
  el.innerHTML = items.map((item) =>
    '<div data-id="' + item.id + '">' + item.name + '</div>'
  ).join('');
  ```
- **Regular expressions.** Prefer simple patterns. Anchor where needed to avoid false matches. Test success and failure cases.

---

## Comments

Comments are a failure of the code to explain itself. When one is necessary, it should justify its existence.

- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. If the comment restates the code, delete it.
- Avoid comments likely to become obsolete. A comment that drifts from the code it describes is worse than no comment.
- No decorative banner or landmark comments (`═══`, `───`, `****`, `/* ── Section ── */`). Use code structure — function names, module boundaries, blank lines — to communicate organization.
- A comment *is* warranted when code intentionally violates a project convention. State the violation, why it exists, and how it is handled instead. Without this, a future reader will "fix" the code back to the convention and break the design.
- Remove dead comments. Commented-out code, obsolete TODOs, and notes that no longer apply are clutter. They mislead readers and accumulate. If the code is gone, the comment goes with it. Version control preserves history — the comment does not need to.

---

## Version Control

- Atomic commits: one logical, cohesive change per commit. A commit should do one thing and do it completely — all files affected by that change, nothing unrelated.
